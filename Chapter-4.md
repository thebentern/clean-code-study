# Comments – Chapter 4

## Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code

* Don't leave a mess and then explain it away.

## Explain Yourself in Code

* Don't write a comment to explain what code does when you can simply make it a well named explanatory method.

# Good Comments

## Legal Comments

* Copyrights and such are necessary from time to time.

## Informative Comments

* Explain things that may be unclear on the surface, such as a regular expression.

## Explanation of Intent

* Explain the why of a potentially difficult to understand decision.

## Clarification

* Translate into more clear language what is happening.

## Warning of Consequences

* Warn your fellow developers if there is danger to particular method.

## TODO Comments

* Make note to go back and resolve something that isn't complete from a functional or qualitative standpoint.

## Public API Documentation

* Make any public API methods well documented in the standards of the language so that consumers can clearly see your methods' intent.

# Bad Comments

## Mumbling

* Complaining about a process or method isn't helpful.

## Redundant Comments

* Don't communicate something that is already clearly expressed in your code.

## Misleading Comments

* Don't write comments that tell a different narrative than your code.

## Journal Comments

* Source control keeps very good records of who changed what.

## Noise Comments

* Don't give useless or redundant information.

## Don’t Use a Comment When You Can Use a Function or a Variable

* Code is the best and first way you should express your intent.

## Position Markers

* Avoid using comments to break up sections of a code file. It may make sense to move those to their own classes or collapse them in regions.

## Closing Brace Comments

* Don't try to help fellow developers read.



## Mandated Comments
