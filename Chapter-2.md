# Meaningful Names – Chapter 2

## Use intention revealing names

* Clearly expressing intent is one of the most important concepts in development

* Choosing good names takes time but saves time

* Imagine the developer picking up your method or class has no context

## Avoid disinformation

* False clues can be harmful to other developers understanding your code

## Make meaningful distinctions

* Make distinctions that are informative on the surface level

What is the difference between these two methods?

```javascript
getPerson()
getPersonInfo()
```
# Use pronouncable names

* "If you can’t pronounce it, you can’t discuss it without sounding like an idiot."

# Use searchable names
