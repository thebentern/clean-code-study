# Meaningful Names – Chapter 2

## Use intention revealing names

* Clearly expressing intent is one of the most important concepts in development.

* Choosing good names takes time but saves time.

* Imagine the developer picking up your method or class has no context.

## Avoid disinformation

* False clues can be harmful to other developers understanding your code.

## Make meaningful distinctions

* Make distinctions that are informative on the surface level.

What is the difference between these two methods?

```javascript
getPerson()
getPersonInfo()
```
## Use pronouncable names

* "If you can’t pronounce it, you can’t discuss it without sounding like an idiot."

## Use searchable names

* Name things so that they can be found easily using tools.

## Avoid Encodings

* Hungarian notation, member prefixes and the like are to be avoided.

* There are unavoidable special cases such as interfaces.

## Avoid mental mapping

* Don't make other developers have to translate into words they know.

## How to name Classes

* Use nouns or noun phrases to identify classes and objects, since they things not actions.

## How to name Methods

* Use verbs or verb phrases to identify methods by the actions they are performing.

## Don't be cute

* Don't sacrifice clarity for the chance to tell a joke.

## Use solution domain names

* Your peers are developers and should be familiar with patterns such as Factory, Command, Vistor, etc.

## Add meaningful context

* Variables can be ambiguous or unclear by themselves. Context is needed to give them meaning

## Don’t add gratuitous context

* Don't append the product or brand to everything. 

* This clutters names with unnecessary fluff and makes it more difficult to search.
