# Unit Tests â€“ Chapter 9

## The Three Laws of TDD

* You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
* You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
* You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

## Keep tests clean

* Tests should be kept as clean as your codebase.
* Tests are documentation. They should read well.

## One Assert per Test

* Each test should assert one aspect of behavior.

## Single Concept per Test

* Each test focuses on a single concept.

## Clean tests are F.I.R.S.T

* Fast - Tests should run quickly.
* Independent - Tests should not depend on one another or the order that they run in to be successful.
* Repeatable
